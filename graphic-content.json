        "description": "For Dear Sunday’s “Honey I’m Home” Tour, I created a playful series of posters inspired by the original Winnie-the-Pooh characters, now in the public domain. With a nod to Pooh Bear’s love of honey, the designs feature band members in classic, costume-inspired illustrations that tie into the tour's theme. Using a warm, retro color palette and whimsical scenes, the posters capture a nostalgic but modern vibe that aligns with the band’s personality. The result is a memorable, engaging set of visuals that work across digital and print formats.",
